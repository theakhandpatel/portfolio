# About Me

Hey! 👋 I'm **Akhand Patel**. I love making servers go brrrrr 💥 and making software less buggy 🐞. During the day, I'm coding away in JavaScript , ensuring things work smoothly. By night, I fight crime 🦸‍♂️ and delve into coding in Go 🐹. I have a masters degree in CSE from IIT Bhubaneswar 🤓.

I'm super curious about how things work under the hood . Sure, I spend a lot of time with JavaScript and building apps that folks enjoy using , but there's so much more I want to learn. Databases 🗃️ and compilers? Like, who even thinks of such stuff?  So, yeah, I've been trying to dabble in that too.

Got a project in mind? I'm always tinkering. Maybe I'll build the next big thing on the internet. Who knows? What I do know is it's going to be mostly fun (maybe a few tears and blood sacrifices), but I'm all for it (this side project is going to be different).

## Free Time
- **Reading**: I love reading books. Mostly fiction, but I do enjoy a good tech book. 📚
- **Coding**: I know, I know. I code for work, but I also code for fun. I love building things and making them work. 💻
- **Cinema**: I'm a huge movie buff. I love watching movies and analyzing them. I'm a sucker for good cinematography—or maybe I'm just a sucker for good movies. 🎬
