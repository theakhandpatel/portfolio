This is a naive in-memory key-value store server implementation written in Go.

**Stack:** <Badge type="tip" text="Golang" /> <Badge type="tip" text="TCP/IP" /> <Badge type="tip" text="Redis Protocol" /> 

## Features

- Supports basic Redis commands: SET, GET, PING, and ECHO.
- Handles concurrent client connections over TCP/IP.
- Uses a synchronized map and locks for data storage to prevent race conditions.
- Supports expiration time for keys.


## Usage

Connect to the Redis server using a Redis client and send commands. The supported commands are:

- `SET`: Set the value of a key.
- `GET`: Get the value of a key.
- `PING`: Check if the server is running.
- `ECHO`: Return the given message.

Example usage:

```shell
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> SET mykey hello
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET mykey
"hello"
127.0.0.1:6379> SET yourkey lost PX 500ms
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET yourkey
nil
127.0.0.1:6379> PING
PONG
127.0.0.1:6379> ECHO hello world
"hello world"
```

## Concurrent Clients and Race Condition Prevention

The Redis server implementation handles concurrent client connections using Goroutines. Each client connection is handled in a separate Goroutine, allowing multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously.

To prevent race conditions when accessing and modifying the data storage (`sync.Map`), the implementation uses locks. The `sync.Map` type provides built-in synchronization for concurrent access, but locks are used when necessary to ensure exclusive access to critical sections of the code.

By utilizing Goroutines and locks, the Redis server ensures concurrent execution and prevents race conditions, maintaining data integrity.
